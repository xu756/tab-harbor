# Tab Harbor

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

**A quiet Chrome new tab workspace for tabs, quick links, desk notes, saved sessions, and lightweight todos.**

Tab Harbor turns Chrome's new tab page into a place where you can keep working. You immediately see what is already open, what should be saved for later, and what still needs your attention.

## ✨ Core Highlights

- **Tabs are automatically organized by domain.** Tab Harbor groups open pages by domain, and moves homepage-style tabs into a dedicated `Homepages` group, so you can quickly see what you are actually working on.
- **You can still organize things around your own workflow.** When domain-based grouping is not enough, you can create manual groups, keep common quick links around, and jump back to the right section from the top icon rail.
- **Saved tabs now behave more like sessions.** You can choose what to save, add tabs to an existing saved session, restore them later, and keep the overview tidy with collapsed session groups when you do not need every tab in front of you.
- **Todos stay close, but out of the way.** The drawer lets you create, edit, delete, search, and archive todos without leaving the page.
- **It keeps getting calmer without getting heavier.** You can switch themes, tune transparency, adjust text and shortcut size, set a custom background, sleep inactive tabs, and clean duplicate tabs with one click, while everything still stays in `chrome.storage.local` with no backend or account.

### Unified tab management

Tab Harbor organizes tabs more like a workspace: **domain-based groups, manual groups, quick access links, and fast jumping from the top icon rail**. If you want to clean up the browser a bit more, you can **also remove duplicate tabs with one click**.

### Saved sessions

Pages you do not need right now can be **saved as sessions, added to an existing session, restored later, or kept collapsed for a quieter overview**.

### Todos and quick jumping

Tab Harbor also works as a tiny action layer: jot down todos, keep short descriptions, archive completed items, and jump back into the right group from the same page.

### Theme switching

When you want the page to feel more like your own workspace, you can **switch themes, tune transparency, adjust text and shortcut size, and use a custom background image**.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/readme/theme-warm-neutral.png" alt="warm neutral" width="100%"></td>
    <td><img src="assets/readme/theme-soft-green.png" alt="soft green" width="100%"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/readme/theme-soft-clay.png" alt="soft clay" width="100%"></td>
    <td><img src="assets/readme/theme-custom-background.png" alt="custom background" width="100%"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Manual sleep control

When you want to slow a tab down without losing it, you can **sleep individual tabs or put an entire group to sleep from the workspace itself**.

## 🌊 Why It Feels Different

Most new tab pages try to be a search box, a wallpaper, or a speed dial. Tab Harbor is closer to a lightweight browser control room. It keeps the messy reality of browsing visible, but turns it into something calmer and more actionable.

That also means it is intentionally lightweight. There is no backend, no sync account, and no extra app to open. It lives exactly where the browsing chaos already happens.

## ⚡ Quick Use

### Install from the Chrome Web Store

The Chrome Web Store listing will be added here after review.

After installing it from the store, open a new tab in Chrome.

### Install with a coding agent

1. Give your coding agent this repo:

   ```text
   https://github.com/xu756/tab-harbor
   ```

2. Ask it to install the extension.
3. Open a new tab in Chrome.

### Install manually

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xu756/tab-harbor.git
   ```

2. Open `chrome://extensions`
3. Turn on **Developer mode**
4. Click **Load unpacked**
5. Select the [`extension/`](extension/) folder in Chrome, or the repo root in Edge
6. Open a new tab

## 🔒 Fully Local

Tab Harbor runs entirely inside the extension. Open tabs come directly from Chrome, and saved sessions, todos, quick links, theme preferences, and layout state stay on your machine through `chrome.storage.local`.

If you publish this repo for other people, they get the code and assets, not your personal browsing data.

## 🛠️ Under the Hood

This is a Manifest V3 Chrome extension with a plain frontend stack and no build step required to use it. You can clone it, load it, and start using it without npm, without a dev server, and without standing up anything else.
